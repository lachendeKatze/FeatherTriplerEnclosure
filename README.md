Enclosure for adafruit Feather Tripler

This is an enclosure & cover for an upcoming home IoT project. I couldn't find a good enclosure for the adafruit
huzzah feather tripler board so made one for myself. The triple board is an elegant wirefree way to qucikly set up
and prototype with the feather and feather wings: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3417. Allows placing three feather 
format boards side-by-side and then you can stack.

The cover for this enclsoure is specific for 2 relay feathers with a stackable feather. Check the pictures if the 
description doesn't make sense.
